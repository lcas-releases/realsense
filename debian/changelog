ros-kinetic-realsense2-camera (2.2.6-1xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * Merge pull request #2 <https://github.com/LCAS/realsense/issues/2> from IntelRealSense/development
    pull from upstream
  * add note to rs_rgbd.launch, reminding users to initially install ros package rgbd_launch.
  * Merge branch 'fix_t265_coordinates' into development
  * removed global variable _device, based on @akirayou at https://github.com/IntelRealSense/realsense-ros/issues/774#issuecomment-494236047
  * Merge branch 'dense_pointcloud' into development
  * Merge branch 'abhijitmajumdar-development' into development
  * Merge branch 'development' of https://github.com/abhijitmajumdar/realsense into abhijitmajumdar-development
  * fixed bug: imu and synced imu are now sent in original device coordinates frames - i.e. gyro_optical_frame, accel_optical_frame, imu_optical_frame. Fix issue for both t265 and d435i with different coordinate systems.
    fixed bug: sending united imu without images enabled.
    add imu_optical_frame_id to nodelet.launch.xml.
  * camera_link for t265 is POSE instead of GYRO.
    fix is needed due to the availability of t265 extrinsics.
  * fix inserted bug reading from file
  * removed lock_guard.
    set_devices_changed_callback called AFTER getDevice()
    Keep checking for devices until device is found - for cases where T265 was momentarily taken by another node at the time of query.
    Add a 3rd, optional camera, to rs_multiple_devices.launch file.
  * fix bug in pointcloud. Used to send points with Z=0.
    add feature: _allow_no_texture_points - if set to true, will send points with depth, both with and without texture.
  * Merge pull request #752 <https://github.com/LCAS/realsense/issues/752> from schmidtp1/sync-get-device
    sync get devices
  * sync get devices
  * add decimation filter at the front of the filter list, before the start of disparity filter
  * change frame_id for imu messages to camera_link's coordinates system, same as imu's sync messages.
